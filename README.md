## Usage

To use the calculator, you can access it through GitHub Pages:

1. Open the [Calculator](https://ankithabangar.github.io/calculator) page in your web browser.
2. Click on the numbers and operators to input your expression.
3. Click "=" to see the result.
4. Use "C" to clear the current input.
5. Use "AC" to clear all values.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the calculator.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the calculator interface.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the functionality of the calculator.

## How It Works

The calculator works by taking input from the user through button clicks and updating the display accordingly. It stores the operands and operator to perform the calculation when the "=" button is clicked. The result is then displayed on the screen.
